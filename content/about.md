title = "About Prime Type"

Prime Type Ltd was created in 2017 as a one man consultancy specializing
in cryptographic applied to software engineering. In short, I was given
a cryptographic paper and I was translating them in `Haskell` or `Rust`
programming languages.

One of our first project was [`sharesafe`](@/blog/sharesafe.md).
It is a very simple command line interface to encrypt messages
using one of the most powerful cryptographic scheme:
<abbr title="Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing">PVSS</abbr>.

We now contract from local to global companies such as [**IOHK** <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://iohk.io), the
company designing and implementing the **cardano blockchain**.

We write software in many programming languages such as C, C++, Rust,
Haskell... And we are expert in cryptographic engineering: i.e. we
will help you design, implement or audit your data protection scheme.
