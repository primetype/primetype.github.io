# One bug for every thousand lines of code

_**Every bug is a potential security issue that can be exploited to break
into your systems.**_

At **Prime Type** we thrive at solving this problem. We have implemented
mission critical software that is both more robust and more secure. And
we can do it with you too. **Prime Type** is a small consultancy based
in Cambridge (UK) and with at heart to develop secure and robust solutions.

At **Prime Type** we know that our customers have already implemented some
common sense processes. But in 100% of the cases, it is in the details that
we found the critical security issues. And this is where we can help **you**.
