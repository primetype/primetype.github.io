# Summary

I am a software engineer, based in Cambridge (UK), with professional experience
in Haskell and C++. My ability to work in both functional and imperative
programming languages allows me to take a targeted yet versatile approach to
projects.

# Professional Experience

#### [Prime Type Ltd](http://primetype.co.uk) (January 2017 — present)

I am the **Director**.

Prime Type is a small consultancy with expertise in **type driven software
development**. I use the latest features of **Haskell**, **Rust** or **C++**
to deliver _secure_, _safe_ and performant solutions.

Projects:

* [**sharesafe**](https://github.com/primetype/sharesafe-lib): leverage *Publicly
  Verifiable Secret Sharing* (**PVSS**) in a library and CLI tool for simple
  secret sharing.

#### [Inchora Direct](https://www.inchora.com/) (May 2017 — present)

I am one of the lead developer of the TenantShop project, entirely written in
**Haskell**.

#### [1Spatial Inc](http://wwww.1spatial.com) (January 2016 — May 2017)

I worked as a **Senior Software Engineer** in the C++ team.

I brought my knowledge from **strong typing** and **functional programming** languages
to help design meaningful and self documented APIs, using template to write
generic and type safe code, making use of new features of C++.

* **C** and legacy software: I participated in maintaining a 20 year old
  library;
* **C++** I have written components wrapping the **C** based code library,
  providing new APIs that are easier to reason with and maintain;
* **Haskell**: I led the migration of a database, allowing to recover
  essential data;

#### PivotCloud Inc (August 2014 — May 2015)

I worked as a **Staff Engineer** in the Haskell team.

My skills in low level software development and network protocols
helped to improve performances on critical projects.  

* I designed and implemented a **DNS-based protocol**  for PivotCloud’s
  *PublicKey Registry* (which is equivalent to keybase.io's public key
  registry).
* I wrote a test suite for the company's modern **cryptographic stack** (in
  Haskell)
* I was closely involved in the design and implementation of the **C/C++
  cryptographic stack**.

#### [Citrix Systems Ltd](http://wwww.citrix.com) (February 2013 — August 2014)

I worked on **XenClient XT** (now open-sourced as [OpenXT](http://openxt.org/)),
a set of tools for virtualisation with high security requirements.

# Skills

* **Functional Programming**: I am proficient in Haskell and have a very good
  knowledge of **OCaml** and **Scala**. I actively contribute to high profile
  open source libraries such as
  [cryptonite](http://github.com/haskell-crypto/cryptonite)
  and [foundation](http://github.com/haskell-foundation/foundation).

* **Imperative Programming**: **C** and **C++** are the foundation of my
  expertise. I have used the languages in large scale projects where
  performance was the main priority.

* **Multi-paradigm Programming: Rust**: I have implemented a
  [git](http://github.com/nicolasdp/git) library in **Rust** using features
  that I am familiar with in Haskell, including **type class** and
  **associated types**.
  I enjoy using the **lifetime checker** and the **borrow checker**,
  which are groundbreaking features of the language.

* **Team work and knowledge sharing**: in my current job I have pioneered *Knowledge sharing sessions*
  to encourage **team building** and ensure that everyone is _competent in any
  components of the projects_.

# Education

* **Masters of Computer Science** from [EPITA](http://www.epita.fr/international)
  (Paris, France — 2013). Specialised in Embedded and Real Time Systems

* **Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles** (Amiens, France — 2010)
  Specialised in Mathematic and Physics. Two intensive years which act as a
  preparatory course with the main goal of training undergraduate students for
  enrolment in one of the Grandes Écoles.
