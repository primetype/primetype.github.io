A fully\nobject oriented JavaScript Library built on top of the\nCardano SDK.\n\nThe Rust Team at IOHK has been working hard to finally provide a stable and\nmeaningful APIs for developers to write their own wallet applications. Now\nthere is a package that is object oriented, that has better error inputs and\nthat have amazing performances even though it has to translate some values\nbetween JavaScript and Rust.\nWhat is it about\nIt all started with the Icarus\nproject last year. At the time we wrote a first version of the crypto graphic\nlibrary in rust and provided hand-written bindings from rust to JS. While it\nworked well to a certain point it was not a great API to utilise.\nBefore you would have to do this:\nconst CardanoCrypto = require('OldCardanoCrypto.js');\n\nconst SEED = new Uint8Array([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,]);\nconst root_xprv = CardanoCrypto.HdWallet.fromSeed(seed);\nconst xpub = CardanoCrypto.HdWallet.toPublic(xprv);\nconst known_address = CardanoCrypto.HdWallet.publicKeyToAddress(xpub);\n\nWhile very raw it also comes without type script annotations.\nNow you can:\nconst MNEMONICS = \"crowd captain hungry tray powder motor coast oppose month shed parent mystery torch resemble index\";\nconst PASSWORD = \"Cardano Rust for the winners!\";\n\nlet settings = Wallet.BlockchainSettings.mainnet();\n\nlet entropy = Wallet.Entropy.from_english_mnemonics(MNEMONICS);\nlet wallet = Wallet.Bip44RootPrivateKey.recover(entropy, PASSWORD);\n\nlet account = wallet.bip44_account(Wallet.AccountIndex.new(0 | 0x80000000));\nlet account_public = account.public();\n\nlet key_prv = account.address_key(false, Wallet.AddressKeyIndex.new(0));\nlet key_pub = account_public.address_key(false, Wallet.AddressKeyIndex.new(0));\n\nlet address = key_pub.bootstrap_era_address(settings);\n","id":"https://primetype.co.uk/blog/cardano-wallet/","title":"The Cardano Wallet"},"https://primetype.co.uk/blog/haskell-foundation-check/":{"body":"Being a haskell library provider means you have a contract toward your user:\nyou provide them with a minimum degree of confidence your code work.\nThis is quite important. And thankfully Haskell maintainers are quite good with\nthat. The language provides the abstraction to avoid the common mistakes;\nthe semantic is checked at compile time. But what about the implementation\nitself? Or the properties? Is it correct? Is your functor actually a functor?\nWill it behave like everyone is expecting? Is your JSON parser parsing the data\nas expected?\n\nThere is an Haskell library for that: Quickcheck. We all know about it, most\nof us are using it. It has been doing the job okay so far.\nNow, other languages like Rust, have decided to include testing as a core\nfeature. I believe it is a good idea to include the testing\nframework as early as possible in the core library; or within the language\nitself.\nFoundation's Check\nSome would rather like a more fragmented libraries. At the\nHaskell Foundation we believe it is\nbetter to unify, to bring together core libraries, to facilitate the\nstandardisation of haskell libraries and have inter operational types.\nThe foundation unifies modern\nHaskell concepts and real word programming. And because\nfoundation is one of the core\nlibrary if not the core library. This is why it comes with a complete\ntesting framework.\nFoundation's Arbitrary\nFoundation's types come with instances of\nArbitrary.\nJust like you would find in Quickcheck (Foundation does not aim to re-invent\nthe wheel):\nclass Arbitrary a where\n    arbitrary :: Gen a\n\nHaving Arbitrary available at the foundation of the ecosystem is really\nuseful and it prevents from seeing the most infamous compilation warning to see:\nOphan Instance.\nIf you are using Quickcheck (and didn't want to see the all its dependencies\nadded to your package) you have certainly seen this compiler message.\nWith Foundation's Check you can add Arbitrary to your types. Allowing you to\nuse it in your tests but also allowing the users of your library to re-use\nthe instance of Arbitrary in their own tests.\nFoundation's test framework DSL\nFoundation is not re-inventing the wheel here. It is mostly what you\nwould have with Quickcheck, except that in Foundation you use the Test type\nconstructor instead of specific functions. In Foundation, it is called\nTest\ndata Test where\n    Group     :: String -&gt; [Test] -&gt; Test\n    Property  :: IsProperty prop =&gt; String -&gt; prop -&gt; Test\n    CheckPlan :: String -&gt; Check () -&gt; Test\n\nso we have 3 constructors:\n\nGroup will allow you to build some sort of hierarchy within your tests;\nProperty test any kind of property (see below);\nCheckPlan check like Property will allow you to validate properties but\nunlike Property it allows you to acquire resources first.\n\nGroup\nWell this is easy:\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = defaultMain $ Test \"Properties\"\n  [ Test \"Functor\" []\n  , Test \"Applicative\" []\n  , Test \"Monad\" []\n  ]\nProperty\nThis constructor regroup the 2 different kind of test you will want to do\nmost of the cases:\n\na unit test: test that convertToBase Base64 \"\" === \"\"\na property test: test that convertFromBase Base64 . convertToBase Base64 === id\n\nAnd to do that, no need for different constructor, the\nIsProperty\nclass will help you.\nUnit Test\nTo do a test once, and only once without generating data (unit test):\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = defaultMain $\n  Property \"base64 of nothing is nothing\"\n           (convertToBase Base64 \"\" == \"\")\n\nThe type check understood this is a Bool type. The test has no parameter,\nit only need to run once.\nProperty Tests\nWhen you want to test a property is true for any arbitrary value of a given type\nyou will want to write a Property Test:\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = defaultMain $\n  Property \"unbase64 . base64 == id\" $ \\d -&gt;\n            Right d === convertFromBase Base64 (convertToBase Base64 d)\n\n\nThe type checker see that you need a parameter, checks it is an instance of\nArbitrary and generate it for you.\nFoundation provides handy function and operator. Here === will provide you\nwith a nice little error display in case of something is different.\nPrime\n  Common\n    ✗ Time failed after 1 test\n       ✗ parseJSON . fromJSON === id failed after 1 test\n         use param: --seed 14494984503458014416\nparameter 1 : 1999-09-03T06:46:42+00:00\nparameter 2 : 1997-02-12T23:17:46+00:00\nProperty `a == b' failed where:\n    a = Right 1999-09-03T06:46:42+00:00 :: Either [Char] Time\n                 ^  ^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^\n    b = Right 1997-02-12T23:17:46+00:00 :: Either [Char] Time\n                 ^  ^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^\n\nIn this case the display is really neat. It won't be perfect all the time but it\ncan provide a useful hint in case of error. Foundation's Check does not only\nfail the test, it provides you with details that can help you same time here.\nBelow is the code that generated the error above:\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = defaultMain $\n  Property \"fromJSON . toJSON == id\" $ \\a (b :: Time) -&gt;\n      Right a === parseJSON (toJSON b)\nThat's it\nreally no magic here. You can check out\nsharesafe-lib's tests for\nexamples or even\nFoundation's tests for more\nexamples.\nSo now, this is not a finished business. Foundation's community is still\nbuilding up.

Unfortunately, there was no straight forward way to\ngenerate a Blake2 digest of 64 bits. The work around could be:\nblakeb_160 :: Data -&gt; Digest (Blake2b_160)\n\nhash64 :: Data -&gt; Bytes\nhash64 = take 8 . toBytes . blakeb_160\n\nThis is will do, but it loses a lot of information. I would have to create my\nown data type to wrap the digest of 8 bytes in order to give it the necessary\nproperties. But this is Haskell, we can do better.\nBlake2\nBlake2b is a cryptographic hash (with\ninteresting properties). One of them is that\nit can generate Digests from 8 bits long to 512bits long, providing it is\ndivisible by 8 ; i.e. digests of 1 byte to 64 bytes.\nCryptonite legacy APIs provide a set of known digests\nbut ideally, we would like to enable every digest size possible, without\nhaving to create 64 different type.\nTL;DR\nYou can have a look at the\nPR in cryptonite.\nThe other languages\nRust\nIn Rust we would create a generic struct.\nstruct Digest&lt;S: usize&gt;([u8;S]);\n\nimpl Digest&lt;S: usize&gt; {\n  fn generate(r: &amp;mut Reader) -&gt; Digest&lt;S&gt; {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nAnd to check the validity of the given S. We could use\ntypenum to perform validity\ncheck at compile time, at the type level.\nC++\nIn C++ we would use templates and some static_assert:\ntemplate&lt;size_t S&gt;\nstruct Digest {\n  // const expression evaluation is already builtin of C++\n  static_assert(8 &lt;= S &amp;&amp; S &lt;= 512, \"invalid digest size\");\n  std::array&lt;uint8_t, S / 8&gt; digest;\n};\nHaskell\nHaskell comes with a brilliant idea, equivalent to the C++ solution (to\na certain extent), the Type Literals.\n-- the type we are interested about today\ndata Nat :: *\n-- a class to limit our type literal to\nclass KnownNat n\n\nIt allows you to write literals in your types and to\nretrieve the value at runtime.\nSo in our case we could write:\n-- we can use the natural like we would use a type parameter.\ndata Blake2b (n :: Nat) = Blake2b\n\n-- we can add conditions\nclass (KnownNat bitlen, 8 &lt;= bitlen, bitlen &lt;= 512) =&gt; Algorithm (Blake2b bitlen) where\n    -- ...\n\nGHC will fail to compile any code making use of the Blake2b 1024 (or any\nother invalid value).\nThe only downside is that it is still missing a proper clean error message to\nhelp developers. This is still possible. Since ghc 8.0 we can define a\ntype error.\n-- we define a new type operator that will call a helper type family\ntype IsAtMost (bitlen :: Nat) (n :: Nat) = IsLE bitlen n (bitlen &lt;=? n) ~ 'True\n\ntype family IsLE (bitlen :: Nat) (n :: Nat) (c :: Bool) where\n    IsLE bitlen n 'True  = 'True\n    IsLE bitlen n 'False = TypeError\n      (     ('Text \"bitlen \" ':&lt;&gt;: 'ShowType bitlen ':&lt;&gt;: 'Text \" is greater than \" ':&lt;&gt;: 'ShowType n)\n      ':$$: ('Text \"You have tried to use an invalid Digest size.

I have been working on a new\nproject for a blockchain company IOHK. My team has been\nworking on the project to broader the customer targets by allowing the\ndevelopment of 3rd party software to work on many different platforms.\n\nHow would you do that? First you will need to make the list of what you need\nand then you see what can fit these requirements.\nWhy we chose Rust\nThe list of requirements was simple:\n\nWe need to be able to control the memory footprint of the applications;\nit needs to work on small embedded device;\nit needs to work in the browser on a cheap computer;\nit needs to leverage the platforms features to provide the best performances;\ndevelopers and integrators need not to have a hard time utilising it.\n\nInitially the cardano protocol is written in haskell. It is a cute language\nwith really interesting language property. Some may argue that\nit is possible to make it fit all the requirements above, but there is\nstill the requirement number 5. : it needs to be easy to integrate in\nthe developer environment.\nSo we took rust.

It allows users to leverage Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing\n(PVSS).\nWhat it is\nIt is a library (first at all) that provides simple interfaces to make use of\nPVSS to encrypt/decrypt data.\nA command line interface (CLI) is provided with the package and it is what we\nwill be talking about here.\nWith what\nThe library is built on top of the pvss\nlibrary built and maintained by IOHK (the company behind\ncardano-sl and the cryptocurrency ADA) and on top of\ncryptonite.\nsharesafe: simple secret sharing\nWhat is Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing\nQuickly, PVSS is a protocol to allow users to create (and verify) a secret made\nby n participants. These n participants only shares their n public keys\nto create a secret. They have decided that m participants (0 &lt; m &lt;= n)\nare needed to retrieve the Secret.\nVery simple : n participants only share their public keys. All or a subset are\nneeded to recover the secret.\nWhat's with sharesafe ?\nThe generated/retrieved secret can be used for multiple purpose. One of them,\nthe one used in sharesafe, is for symmetric encryption.\ni.e. if one want to send private data, it only needs the public key of the\nrecipient. So now you can say that there is already asymmetric encryption for\nthat and you would be right. PVSS here is interesting because you can add\nyourself in the scheme. The sender can set itself as a participant of share\nand can retrieve the same secret.\nThis is interesting because it provides us with a way to verify who participated\nto a given secret/share.\nYou can checkout the use case described in the README.md of sharesafe\nHow to use the CLI to generate private key\ncreate the keypair and share the public key\n# generate to the standard output\nsharesafe key new\n# generate in a file\nsharesafe key new -o &lt;generated-key-pair&gt;\n\nby default we are not setting a password for the secret. If you want to set a\npassword, use --password. By default the password is the empty string.\nTo export the public key:\n# by default `sharesafe` will read the keypair from the standard input\n# and will write the exported public key to the standard output.\nsharesafe key export-public -i &lt;generated-key-pair&gt; -o &lt;exported-public-key&gt;\nCreate an encryption key\nThis command will create the shares for every participants, the commitments and\nthe encryption key.\n\nthe shares will be needed to recover the secret later on. Only the secret\nkey associated to the share can unlock the share;\nyou will need the same amount as the threshold  of unlocked shares to\nrecover the secret;\nthe commitments can be used to check the shares;\nencryption-key is the key generated from the secret;\n\nThis command will create a locked share for every given &lt;public-key&gt;: the\nname will be the input file name with the suffix replaced to share.\nsharesafe pvss new --participant public-key1 \\\n                   --participant public-key2 \\\n                   --threshold=1 \\\n                   --commitments commitments \\\n                   -o encryption-key\n\nOnce you have generated the shares, you can simply share them Publicly (or not).\nOnly the private key associated to the public key used to generate the share\ncan unlock the share.\nVerify a share against the commitments\nsharesafe pvss verify -s &lt;locked-share&gt; -c commitments\nUnlock the share\nsharesafe pvss open-share -s &lt;share-file&gt; -k &lt;private-key&gt; -o &lt;opened-share&gt;\nRecover the encryption key\nsharesafe pvss recover -s $(cat &lt;opened-share&gt;) \\\n                       -o encryption-key.recovered\nHow to use the CLI for encryption\nThe encryption-key is generated using Diffie-Hellman derivation from the\nPVSS secret.

Some believe\nwe must use exceptions, others prefer the old C style error code.\nI believe both are good options and have valid concerns about the other. I\nbelieve we should do both.\nConcrete examples\nC's free function\nIf you were to open a file, in C you would use the following function:\nint open(char const* path, int oflag, ...);\n\nopen returns either -1 or a valid file descriptor. If you have an\nerror and you want to find out what happened you will need to check errno\nthen try to guess if EACCES is the one you are concerned about.\nIt is not easy to use but it has been working for the last couple of decades.\nC++'s Standard library\nC++ comes with some wrapper around the C function open. There is a\nclass fstream which provides the method\nopen.\nvoid open (const char* filename,\n           ios_base::openmode mode = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);\n\nIf the function has failed, you will need to look at the\nios::good to find out if the\nfunction succeeded or otherwise the opened fstream would throw an exception on\nthe next operation, fair enough. The best practice is clearly to check for\nios::good function.\nCan't we do better ?\nI think we can do much better. Ideally, we would like the signature of the\nfunction to be self explanatory, to describe precisely what users of this\nfunction should expect.\nBoost\nBoost provides a data structure: boost::variant. It is an\nenhanced version of the C's unions, with strong typing.\n// you can create an object which is either an `int` or a `std::string`\nboost::variant&lt;int, std::string&gt; obj = 10;\n\n// you can get it's content knowing its type\nint v = boost::get&lt;int&gt;(obj); // OK\n\n// you can mutate the content\nobj = \"Prime Type Ltd\"; // Ok\n\n// and access its value with its type\nstd::string p = boost::get&lt;std::string&gt;(obj); // OK\n\n// but you cannot get it wrong:\nboost::get&lt;int&gt;(obj); // obj has been set to a std::string...\n\nThis is really similar to what I described in my\nprevious post.\nThe idea\nWe will wrap boost::variant in a structure and provide Rust-like\nmethod to map the content of the value, chain with other function etc...\ntemplate&lt;class result_type, class error_type&gt;\nstruct Result {\n  boost::variant&lt;result_type, error_type&gt; variant_;\n};\n\nAnd then we could do the following:\nResult&lt;std::fstream, std::runtime_error&gt; open( char const* filename\n                                             , ios_base::openmode mode = ios_base::in\n                                                                       | ios_base::out\n                                             );\n\n\nThis is it !\n\nWe now have a function, which explicitly tells us what the function is doing.\nIt is a function which open the file, takes a filename and mode, and\nreturns either the successfully opened fstream or a runtime_error.\nThe Result\nYou can find the complete source code with the test\non github.\nExample of usage\nNow we can do pretty interesting thing with this:\nWe can throw an exception if we don't want to handle the error right now:\n// either open succeed or throw the `std::runtime_error`\nauto fs = open(\"/invalid/file.txt\").unwrap();\n\nOr we can recover:\n// if we fail to open the file we would execute the given lambda.\nauto fs = open(\"/invalid/file.txt\")\n            .or_else([](std::runtime_error&amp;&amp; )\n              {\n                return std::move(open(\"/valid/file.txt\"));\n              }\n            );\n\nOr even more complex yet interesting chaining:\nstd::string line = open(\"example.txt\")\n  .and_then([](std::fstream&amp;&amp; fs) { return readline(fs); })\n  .and_then([](std::string&amp;&amp; s) { return parseline(s); })\n  .or_else([](std::runtime_error&amp;&amp;) {return open(\"test.txt\")})\n  .and_then([](std::fstream&amp;&amp; fs) { return readline(fs); })\n  .and_then([](std::string&amp;&amp; s) { return parseline(s); })\n  .expect(\"cannot parse line of both example.txt and test.txt\");\n","id":"https://primetype.co.uk/blog/yet-another-error-handling-2/","title":"C++: Yet Another Kind of error handling (Part 2)"},"https://primetype.co.uk/blog/yet-another-error-handling/":{"body":"I have been a C++ developer for a little while, I have seen different methods\nto provide meaningful API:\n\nthe C-like: using error code and returning output in the parameter;\nthe exception-like: using exceptions.\n\nThe difficulties are to:\n\nguarantee that the error handling is documented;\nensure it does not change (requires a lot of regression tests);\nkeep undefined behaviours as \"exceptional\".\n\nThat's it: exceptions are for exceptional situations. And again, it is not\neasy to provide up to date documentation of the kind of exceptions\nyour function may throw.\nSo, let's try something else. Let's see what other languages have done to\ntry to solve the issue of non self documented APIs.\nHaskell\nCertainly my favourite language. In Haskell there are different methods\nto return error information to the user. The simplest\nis Either or Maybe.\n-- define an error type\ndata Error = IOError\n           | UTF8Error\n\n-- just provide the Function signature to show you how\n-- self documented it is\nreadFile :: FilePath -&gt; Either Error Text\n\nSo the function is named: readFile, it takes a FilePath as parameter\nand it returns either an Error or a Text.\nThis design provides you with some information about the kind of error handled\nby this function. I don't say this function won't throw an exception: but the\nsignature of the function tells you what you can expect.\nNow, you know how you can use it:\nIf you want to interrupt your program now:\nmain = do\n   case readFile \"document.txt\" of\n      Left err -&gt; error $ \"error in readFile: \" ++ show err\n      Right txt -&gt; printLn txt\n\nIf you want to fail quietly\nmain = do\n   either\n      (return ())\n      print\n      (readFile \"document.txt\")\nRust\nThe latest language I have been looking into.
